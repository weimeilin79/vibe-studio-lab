"""Step 7 - the audience's feedback. The step 6 graph plus one more reader.

RAG Engine is not a callback and not a tool: it is a third source in the
research fan-out. read_feedback (agent/graph.py) embeds tonight's idea,
asks the corpus for the nearest passages of audience comments, and the
join hands them to the proposer with the trends and the backlog.
