"""The app's automation - the chains behind Vibe Studio's three buttons.

  python -m agent.auto direction --pick 1
      answer the form, and if the policy gate cleared it, roll straight
      into rendering. (BLOCK ends the lap politely - nothing to chain.)

  python -m agent.auto ship
      approve the thumbnail, then finish: deliver every render, run the
      publish backstop, put the video on the wall (and the room, silently).

  python -m agent.auto rethumb
      reject the current thumbnail, generate a fresh one from the SAME
      direction, and ask for approval again.

Chains live HERE, not in the graph: they cross the world (renders, publish),
and the graph never waits for the world.
