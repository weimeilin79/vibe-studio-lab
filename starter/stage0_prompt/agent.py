"""Stage 0 - the whole channel as ONE prompt.

Every sentence of the instruction below is a JOB. Over the next two
chapters, each job becomes a NODE in a drawn graph - the codelab's
replacement table maps sentence -> node, one by one. The tools here call
the same sources the graph's research nodes read; only the shape differs.

Run it and watch what you get: research folded into prose you must re-read,
an "agree with the creator" sentence that can be talked past, and a
blacklist the model certifies for itself. Nothing here is checkable.
