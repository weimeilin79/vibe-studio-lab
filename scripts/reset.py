# ── the half of sessions.db that is NOT this lap's ──────────────────────────
# runs/sessions.db is two stores sharing one file, and only one of them is a
# lap. ADK keeps `user:`-prefixed state in its OWN table - `user_states`, keyed
# (app_name, user_id), the prefix stripped on the way in - with no foreign key
# to `sessions` and no cascade from it (google/adk/sessions/schemas/v1.py:
# StorageUserState vs StorageSession; delete_session() is a single DELETE
# against StorageSession and never mentions user_states). That separation IS
# the lesson the lab teaches: `user:` = this USER, every session.
#
# So the file still goes. A brand-new file is the only clean-slate guarantee
# Restart can make - it is the learner's way out of a session that can never
# resume again (a stored interrupt response that fails re-validation forever),
# and a selective DELETE cannot help you when
# the store is the thing that is broken. The user's half is carried across the
# swap by hand instead: read out before, written back after.
